I'm a computer science & business student at UBC who has a unique combination of skill sets in front-end/web, back-end, and design. :nerd_face: I love learning new things and meeting new people!

:hatching_chick: **What Iâ€™m working on:** I recently wrapped up my internship at Coinbase, where I worked on Coinbase's new Prime product offering for institutional investors (Technologies: React, TypeScript, Golang, Ruby). I'm currently also working as a developer at [nwPlus](https://github.com/nwplus), building websites and tooling for Western Canada's Largest Hackathon Organization!
